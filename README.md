Problem & Solution:

Many businesses, particularly in retail environments, face the challenge of marketing to their consumer base but lack the valuable insights that would allow them 
to understand and appeal to their target audience. Without these insights, customers may be left dissatisfied, and businesses can lose potential customers. Many 
companies have tried to solve this issue using surveys or interviews with limited success due to low consumer participation and biases that cause inaccuracies. 
However, what if businesses had access to real-time demographic data and could view daily trends of who comes in and out of their store. This has potentially unlimited applications from just learning who mainly consumes your products to altering a business’ marketing throughout the day to bring in more clientele. If a business wants
to engage a different group of consumers or find out if they are missing a demographic group of clienteles, this data can be utilized to see the effectiveness of 
marketing and inform crucial business decisions. Marketing can be the difference between a company that prospers and one that shuts down especially with new or local businesses. A business that is new to an area or a local business seeing slow growth needs demographic data to be able to tailor their business to their consumers 
through marketing strategies, product offerings, and customer engagement. Businesses that cater to their consumers would have a higher competitive advantage and offer 
consumers a better overall experience.

We intend to collect real-time demographic data in the form of age and gender through store cameras and images to help businesses understand, market, and cater to their clientele. Our project will utilize the IMDB-Wiki dataset, YOLO, and four different machine learning classifiers. This should allow us to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately and precisely predicting the age and gender of a business’ clientele.

With regards to HCI research and IRB approval, the images we collect will be deleted immediately after estimating an individual’s age and gender. Age and gender are unidentifiable information even when combined, so there should be no cause for ethical concerns.
